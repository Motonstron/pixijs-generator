## Getting Started

To start you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

Once you have these installed you can run: `npm install -g generator-pixijs`

Highlight the PixiJS Generator, and press enter. You will be presented with a set of libraries that can be utilised within your game, however if you don't want to use these libraries the scaffolding will still work without them and you can use your own.

It may take a while to create the project, so go grab a drink and we'll see you on the other side.
